Amazee Labs Simple D7 -> D8 Migration
==========

This is some custom Code which is able to do a migration from D7 to D8.
It can migrate Nodes and Users (Authors of Nodes).

It's heavy customized to the needs from the amazeelabs.com D7 to D8 migration.
If you wanna use this code, you most probably need to adapt it.
The module connects to a Services Endpoint on D7, please check d7_services_export.txt for en export of the Service Configuration.

This is fully ALPHA Code, we used it for our migration, but we cannot guarantee that it will not break your D8 site.
